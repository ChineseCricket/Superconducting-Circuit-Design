# Superconducting-Circuit-Design
GDSPY-based code to design superconducting circuits and flux-tunable resonators
All the functions needed for the design are defined in the Library file.
All the geometric parameters needed for the design are defined in the Definitions file.
The main code is in the Design file which calls the functions and parameters from the above files.
The design changes are intended to be made in the Design and Definitions files while the Library file remains unchanged. 
Please change the file paths to the imported GDS files to include the wafer infrastructure and the logo.
